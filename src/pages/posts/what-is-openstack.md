## What is OpenStack?

OpenStack is open source, enterprise-quality private cloud software with its own set of distinct value propositions.\
\
OpenStack started out as a collaboration between NASA and RackSpace, the cloud services provider, to use a large cluster of servers for processing huge amounts of data. Since then, OpenStack has grown to be the cloud computing choice for teams of all sizes across the globe.\
\
OpenStack itself is several distinct independent projects that individually provide pieces of cloud computing functionality. There are a number of these projects that make up the "core" OpenStack services that you need to run OpenStack.
