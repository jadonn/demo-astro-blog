# Jadon's Demo Astro Blog

## What is this repo about?

This is a simple blog website I wrote over a few hours using Astro to provide talking points for how I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve problems. The code in this blog is intended to provide specific, focused demonstrations of using foundational web technologies to produce something functional and valuable.

## Why not use React/some other framework/some library to do whatever?

Well, I could have done that, but I firmly believe if you lose touch with the fundamentals of the platform with which you are working, you open yourself up to trouble down the round through having the wrong abstractions. At this early stage of development in this particular problem space, I am extremely concerned with preserving the ability to easily and quickly change my code, and I believe sticking to the platform's primitives (that is, HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript) lets me do that.
